Northstar mod template for northstar.thunderstore.io compatible mods.

# READ!

Please change the folder name of Example.Mod to your mods name.

Please modify the manifest.json and mod.json and change everything to your mods needs.
Make sure the version between them both is the same.

There is a empty example Squirrel script in mods/Example.Mod/mod/scripts/vscripts/. You likely want to rename and modify or replace that file.
